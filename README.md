# NLCD

This library provides some helpers related to the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).  The NLCD is created by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) and is available on their [website][MRLC].

I found myself duplicating this or copying it from project to project so I thought I'd make it available through PYPI for myself and anyone else who might want it.
